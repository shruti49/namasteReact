Ques - Order of lifecycle methods called in class based component?
Ans - There are 3 lifecycle methods.
Mounting , Updating,Unmounting

Mounting has 2 phases - Render Phase and Commit Phase 
In render phase the constructor is called whenever an instance of class is created. And then the component
renders initially. 
Before commit phase react uses a reconciliation algo which has a diff techniue to figure out 
all the updates in virtual DOM. After that comes the commit phase where the Orginal DOM is then updated 
and then component is mounted with (componentDidMount method)

Updating - This methods ocuurs subsequently whenever there's an update in the state of the component. 
As soon as the state is updated the components re-renders. Then actul DOM updation occurs and the 
components gets updated with (componentDidUpdate method) 

Unmounting - This methods occurs whenever the component is removed from the page. (routing to another component);
(componentWillUnmount)

Ques - Why do we use componentDidMount?
Ans - The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when 
the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). 
This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e 
after the component is rendered.

All the AJAX requests and the DOM or state updation should be coded in the 
componentDidMount() method block. We can also set up all the major 
subscriptions here but to avoid any performance issues, always remember to 
unsubscribe them in the componentWillUnmount() method. 


Ques - Why do we use componentWillUnmount?
Ans - Whenever we want to destroy/unmount any component we use componentWillUnmount() to perfor
all the cleanup functions.
This method is called during the Unmounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e
 before the component gets unmounted.


All the cleanups such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, 
or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount() 
should be coded in the componentWillUnmount() method block.
