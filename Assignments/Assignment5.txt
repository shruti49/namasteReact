Ques - Why do we need a useState Hook?
Ans - We can't use normal js variables in react because react does not re-render after updating the values of normal vars.
React uses state variables which are provided by useState hook. This hook returns an array with 2 values -
an initial state and the method to update that initial state. Once the value is updated it triggers re-render which is not possible in
normal js variable. The useState hook takes a default value as an initial param.
